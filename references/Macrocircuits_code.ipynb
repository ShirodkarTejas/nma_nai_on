    "## Background\n",
    "This project explores how we can build a biologically inspired artificial neural network (ANN) architecture, derived from the C. Elegans motor circuit, for the control of a simulated Swimmer agent. Traditional motor control ANNs often rely on generic, fully connected multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which demand extensive training data, offer limited transferability, and possess complex internal dynamics that challenge interpretability. The project aims to understand how the biologically motivated ANN, which is shaped by evolution to be highly structured and sparse, could help to solve these problems and provide advantages in the domain of motor control. We will train MLPs using algorithms such as PPO, DDPG, and ES, and compare their performance in terms of rewards and sample efficiency with our bio-inspired ANN. The project also includes visualizing the C. Elegans connectome and building the network using this circuitry. We will conduct various ablation analyses by removing sign and weight-sharing constraints, and altering environmental parameters like the swimmer’s length or viscosity. These investigations aim to understand how architecture and modularity impact performance and learning across different environments. Finally, the project aims at building an agent that is robust to environmental variations, navigating towards specific targets, and enhancing our understanding of bio-inspired motor control.  \n",

    "This particular project connects a couple of distinct ideas explored throughout the course. Firstly, the innate ability to learn a certain set of actions quickly is the main topic of [Tutorial 4](https://neuroai.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W2D4_Macrolearning/student/W2D4_Tutorial4.html) for **W2D4** on biological meta-learning. The focus comes with the observation that the brain is not of a generic architecture but is a highly structured and optimized hierarchy of modules, the importance of which is highlighted in [Tutorial 3](https://neuroai.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W2D1_Macrocircuits/student/W2D1_Tutorial3.html) for **W2D1**, forming inductive bias for efficient motor control. The default model for the agent used here is already known Actor-Critic; you had the opportunity to observe in already mentioned tutorials as well as in [Tutorial 3](https://neuroai.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W1D2_ComparingTasks/student/W1D2_Tutorial3.html) for **W1D2**."

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will employ the [tonic_rl](https://github.com/fabiopardo/tonic) library, which provides a robust framework for training RL agents. Throughout most of this project, you will primarily be modifying the environment or the model architecture. Therefore, I suggest treating these algorithms as a \"black box\" for now. Simply put, you input an untrained model, and the algorithm processes and returns a well-trained model. This approach allows us to focus on the impact of different architectures and environmental settings without delving deeply into the algorithmic complexities at this stage."

    "Notice that the NCAP architecture is highly sparse and interpretable as compared to the MLP. Moreover notice that the ncap architecture can be completely embedded within a fully connected MLP of 3 hidden layers and ReLU nonlinearities. This enables us to do a thorough investigation into how specific architectural elements influence both performance and the learning process. By leveraging this capability, we can systematically analyze the impact of the architectural preferences inherent to the model and make better design choices.\n",
