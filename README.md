## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements and extends the **Neural Central Pattern Generator (NCAP)** model for adaptive locomotion in mixed environments. Inspired by the C. elegans motor circuit, we aim to build biologically plausible neural models that can generalize well and adapt to different environmental conditions through **curriculum learning**.

### Key Goals
- **Build biologically plausible models** based on neural circuit architecture
- **Achieve effective swimming and crawling** through curriculum learning (target: 5-15m distance)
- **Enable adaptive locomotion** across different environments (water/land transitions)
- **Study progressive learning** from simple to complex environmental conditions

## 🧠 Biological Inspiration

The project is based on the **NCAP (Neural Central Pattern Generator)** architecture from the paper:
> ["Neural circuit architectural priors for embodied control"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05242)

This biologically-inspired approach leverages:
- **Modular neural circuits** derived from C. elegans motor control
- **Oscillatory patterns** for rhythmic locomotion (60-step period)
- **Traveling wave coordination** with consistent phase delays between joints
- **Biological constraints** preserving muscle antagonism and coupling strength

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **NCAP Model**: Biologically-inspired neural circuit with 4 learnable parameters
- **Progressive Mixed Environment**: Curriculum from pure swimming to complex swim+crawl
- **Curriculum Training Framework**: Phase-based learning with automatic progression
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Performance tracking across all training phases

## 🔬 Key Research Discoveries

### **🚨 Environment Physics Issues Solved**
Our comprehensive analysis revealed that **environment complexity, not model architecture, was the primary bottleneck**:

- **Simple Environment Performance**: 0.30m (excellent zero-shot for NCAP)
- **Complex Environment Performance**: 0.06m (5x worse due to physics issues)
- **Solution**: Progressive curriculum starting simple, adding complexity gradually

### **📏 Body Scale Analysis**
Swimmer analysis revealed performance must be measured relative to body size:
- **Swimmer body length**: ~3.0m (6 links × 0.5m each)
- **Previous "good" 0.3m**: Only **0.1 body lengths** (poor performance)
- **Target performance**: **5-15m** (2-5 body lengths for meaningful swimming)

### **🧬 Biological Circuit Validation**  
NCAP architecture confirmed working perfectly:
- ✅ **Traveling wave patterns** with consistent 19-step phase delays
- ✅ **Oscillatory behavior** with 60-step periods (1 second at 60Hz)
- ✅ **Muscle antagonism** preserved with biological constraints
- ✅ **Zero-shot capability** demonstrates biological circuit effectiveness

## 🔧 Component Testing

Before running long training, verify setup:
```bash
# Test all curriculum components
python tests/test_curriculum_setup.py
```

This validates:
- Progressive environment phase transitions
- NCAP model creation and forward pass
- Agent-environment interaction  
- Biological constraint preservation
- Performance evaluation across phases
